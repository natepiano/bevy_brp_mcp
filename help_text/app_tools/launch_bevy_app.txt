Launches a Bevy game engine application in detached mode with full asset loading support. Sets up the correct working directory and environment variables so assets load properly. Features:
- Detached execution (won't block other operations)
- Automatic log file creation in temp directory
- Proper CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR setup for asset loading
- Choice of debug (default) or release profile
The app must be built before launching. Use list_bevy_apps first to check build status. Logs are saved to help debug any issues. Use list_logs to view available logs, read_log to examine log contents, and cleanup_logs to manage disk space.
