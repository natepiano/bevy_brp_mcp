Launches a Bevy example project in detached mode with cargo run --example. Automatically handles building, asset loading, and logging. Features:
- Runs examples with cargo run --example command
- Builds the example if needed before running
- Detached execution (won't block other operations)
- Automatic log file creation in temp directory
- Proper CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR setup for asset loading
- Choice of debug (default) or release profile
Use list_bevy_examples first to see available examples. The example will be built automatically if not already built. Logs are saved to help debug any issues. Use list_logs to view available logs, read_log to examine log contents, and cleanup_logs to manage disk space.
