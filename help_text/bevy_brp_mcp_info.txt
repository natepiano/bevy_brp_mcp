Bevy BRP MCP Server - Remote protocol interface for Bevy game engine applications

This MCP server provides tools to interact with Bevy applications through the Bevy Remote Protocol (BRP).

Capabilities:
• App Management: Launch and monitor Bevy apps and examples with automatic log capture
• BRP Interaction: Query entities, list components, and execute arbitrary BRP methods
• Log Management: View, search, and clean up application logs

BRP Component/Resource Registration:
For components and resources to be accessible through BRP, they must meet ALL requirements:
1. Derive required traits: #[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize)]
2. Add reflect attribute: #[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
3. Register with app: app.register_type::<YourComponent>()

For Resources, use Resource instead of Component in the above steps.

Note: Only registered components will appear in BRP queries and listings.
