Stop an active watch subscription by its watch ID.

This is useful for:
- Freeing resources when done monitoring
- Managing multiple active watches
- Stopping watches before starting new ones

Parameters:
- watch_id (required): The numeric watch ID returned from brp_get_watch or brp_list_watch

Returns:
- status: "success" if stopped successfully, "error" if failed
- message: Confirmation or error message

Behavior:
- Stops the background streaming task immediately
- Log file remains on disk for later analysis
- Use read_log to examine captured data after stopping
- Use cleanup_logs to remove old watch logs

IMPORTANT: Always stop watches when done to free resources. Watches also stop automatically when the Bevy app shuts down.
