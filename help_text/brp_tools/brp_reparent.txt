Change the parent of an entity using the bevy/reparent BRP method. Modifies the hierarchical relationship between entities by setting or removing parent-child relationships.

This is useful for:
- Reorganizing entity hierarchies
- Implementing drag-and-drop in editors
- Managing scene graphs
- Dynamic object attachment/detachment

Parameters:
- entities (required): Array of entity IDs to reparent
- parent (optional): The new parent entity ID (omit to remove parent)
- port (optional): The BRP port (default: 15702)

Behavior:
- All specified entities will become children of the parent entity
- If parent is omitted, entities become root entities (no parent)
- Existing parent relationships are replaced
- Transform hierarchies are automatically updated

Example usage:
```json
{
  "entities": [123, 124, 125],
  "parent": 100
}
```

To remove parent (make entities root-level):
```json
{
  "entities": [123, 124, 125]
}
```

Notes:
- Parent entity must exist
- Cannot create circular hierarchies (entity cannot be its own ancestor)
- Transform propagation respects the new hierarchy

IMPORTANT: Both parent and child entities must have Transform components for spatial hierarchies to work correctly.
