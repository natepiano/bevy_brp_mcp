For components to be visible through BRP, they must meet ALL three requirements:
1. Derive the required traits: #[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize)]
2. Add the reflect attribute: #[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
3. Register with the app: app.register_type::<YourComponent>()

For Resources, use Resource instead of Component in the above.
