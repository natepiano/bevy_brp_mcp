For components and resources to be accessible through BRP, they must meet ALL requirements:
1. Derive required traits: #[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize)]
2. Add reflect attribute: #[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
3. Register with app: app.register_type::<YourComponent>()

For Resources, use Resource instead of Component in the above steps.
