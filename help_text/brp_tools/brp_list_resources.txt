List all resources in the Bevy app using the bevy/list_resources BRP method. Returns an array of all resource types currently registered in the application.

This is useful for:
- Discovering available resources in a Bevy app
- Debugging resource registration issues
- Building resource inspection tools
- Understanding app architecture

Parameters:
- port (optional): The BRP port (default: 15702)

Returns an array of fully-qualified resource type names, such as:
- "bevy_time::time::Time"
- "bevy_asset::assets::Assets<bevy_render::texture::image::Image>"
- "bevy_window::window::Windows"

Note: Only resources that have been registered with BRP will appear in this list. Resources must implement the necessary reflection traits to be accessible via BRP.
