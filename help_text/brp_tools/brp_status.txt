Check if a specific Bevy app is running and has BRP (Bevy Remote Protocol) enabled. This tool helps diagnose whether your app is running and properly configured with RemotePlugin.

This is useful for:
- Verifying that your Bevy app is currently running
- Confirming BRP is enabled and responding on the expected port
- Troubleshooting connection issues between MCP tools and your Bevy app
- Getting process information (PID) for running apps

Parameters:
- app_name (required): Name of the Bevy app to check
- port (optional): Port to check for BRP connectivity (default: 15702)

Return status values:
- "running_with_brp": App is running and BRP is responding
- "running_no_brp": App is running but BRP is not responding (check RemotePlugin configuration)  
- "brp_found_app_not_detected": BRP responds but the specific app process wasn't detected (may be running with different build profile)
- "not_running": App is not currently running

The response includes:
- status: One of the status values above
- app_name: The app name that was checked
- port: The port that was checked
- app_running: Boolean indicating if the app process was detected
- brp_responsive: Boolean indicating if BRP responded
- app_pid: Process ID if the app was detected (null otherwise)

IMPORTANT: For BRP to work, your Bevy app must include the RemotePlugin in its plugin configuration.
