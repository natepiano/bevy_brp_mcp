Remove components from an entity using the bevy/remove BRP method. Removes specified component types from an entity while keeping the entity itself and other components intact.

This is useful for:
- Removing behaviors or capabilities from entities
- Implementing component-based state machines
- Optimizing entities by removing unused components
- Dynamic entity modification in tools

Parameters:
- entity_id (required): The entity ID to remove components from
- components (required): Array of component type names to remove
- port (optional): The BRP port (default: 15702)

Example usage:
```json
{
  "entity": 123,
  "components": [
    "bevy_sprite::sprite::Sprite",
    "bevy_render::camera::camera::Camera"
  ]
}
```

Note:
- Removing components that don't exist on the entity is not an error
- The entity continues to exist even if all components are removed
- To completely remove an entity, use bevy_destroy instead

IMPORTANT: Component type names must be fully-qualified.
