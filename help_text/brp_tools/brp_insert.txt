Insert components into an existing entity using the bevy/insert BRP method. Adds new components or replaces existing ones on a specific entity.

This is useful for:
- Adding new behaviors to existing entities
- Modifying entity capabilities at runtime
- Implementing component-based state changes
- Building entity modification tools

Parameters:
- entity_id (required): The entity ID to insert components into
- components (required): Object containing component data to insert
  - Keys are component type names (fully-qualified)
  - Values are the component data
- port (optional): The BRP port (default: 15702)

Behavior:
- If a component type already exists on the entity, it will be replaced
- If a component type doesn't exist, it will be added
- Other existing components remain unchanged

Example usage:
```json
{
  "entity": 123,
  "components": {
    "bevy_sprite::sprite::Sprite": {
      "color": {"r": 1.0, "g": 0.0, "b": 0.0, "a": 1.0}
    }
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT: Components must be properly registered with BRP to be insertable.
