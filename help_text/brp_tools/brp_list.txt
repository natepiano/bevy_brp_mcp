List components using the bevy/list BRP method. Lists all registered components in the Bevy app, or lists components present on a specific entity. This tool wraps the bevy/list method for easier use.

This is useful for:
- Discovering what component types are available in the app
- Inspecting what components a specific entity has
- Getting fully-qualified type names for use with other BRP methods

IMPORTANT: For components to be visible through BRP, they must meet ALL three requirements:
1. Derive the required traits: #[derive(Component, Reflect, Serialize, Deserialize)]
2. Add the reflect attribute: #[reflect(Component, Serialize, Deserialize)]
3. Register with the app: app.register_type::<YourComponent>()

For Resources, use Resource instead of Component in the above.
