List components using the bevy/list BRP method. Lists all registered components in the Bevy app, or lists components present on a specific entity. This tool wraps the bevy/list method for easier use.

This is useful for:
- Discovering what component types are available in the app
- Inspecting what components a specific entity has
- Getting fully-qualified type names for use with other BRP methods
