Start watching an entity for component changes with file-based logging.

This is useful for:
- Monitoring component value changes on specific entities
- Debugging entity state over time
- Tracking component additions/removals

Parameters:
- entity (required): The entity ID to watch for component changes
- components (required): Array of component types to watch (must contain at least one)
- port (optional): BRP port to connect to (default: 15702)

Returns:
- status: "success" if watch started successfully
- watch_id: Unique identifier (use with bevy_stop_watch)
- log_path: Path to log file where updates are written

Watch behavior:
- Creates log file at: /tmp/bevy_brp_mcp_watch_*
- Logs COMPONENT_UPDATE entries when watched components change
- Runs in background until stopped with bevy_stop_watch
- Use read_log to view updates, cleanup_logs to remove old logs

IMPORTANT: Only monitors components specified in the components array. Watches consume resources - always stop when done.
