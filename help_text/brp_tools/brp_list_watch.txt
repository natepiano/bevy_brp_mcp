Start watching an entity for component list changes (additions/removals) with file-based logging.

This is useful for:
- Monitoring when components are added/removed from entities
- Debugging component lifecycle
- Tracking entity state transitions

Parameters:
- entity (required): The entity ID to watch for component list changes
- port (optional): BRP port to connect to (default: 15702)

Returns:
- status: "success" if watch started successfully
- watch_id: Unique identifier (use with bevy_stop_watch)
- log_path: Path to log file where updates are written

Watch behavior:
- Creates log file at: /tmp/bevy_brp_mcp_watch_*
- Logs LIST_UPDATE entries showing added/removed/current components
- Runs in background until stopped with bevy_stop_watch
- Use read_log to view updates, cleanup_logs to remove old logs

Note: Unlike brp_get_watch, this tracks structural changes (component additions/removals), not value changes.
