Insert or update a resource using the bevy/insert_resource BRP method. Sets the value of a resource in the Bevy app, creating it if it doesn't exist or updating it if it does.

This is useful for:
- Modifying global app configuration
- Injecting external data into the app
- Testing different resource states
- Building configuration tools

Parameters:
- resource (required): The fully-qualified type name of the resource to insert
- value (required): The resource value to insert
- port (optional): The BRP port (default: 15702)

Example usage:
```json
{
  "resource": "my_game::config::GameConfig",
  "value": {
    "difficulty": "hard",
    "sound_volume": 0.8,
    "graphics_quality": "high"
  }
}
```

Behavior:
- If the resource already exists, it will be completely replaced
- If the resource doesn't exist, it will be created
- The resource type must be registered with BRP

IMPORTANT: 
- Resources must implement the necessary reflection traits
- Be careful when updating resources as it affects the entire app
- Some resources may have specific initialization requirements
