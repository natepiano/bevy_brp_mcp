Destroy an entity using the bevy/destroy BRP method. Permanently removes an entity and all its components from the Bevy world.

- Cleaning up temporary entities
- Managing entity lifecycles in your Bevy app

Parameters:
- entity_id (required): The entity ID to destroy
- port (optional): The BRP port (default: 15702)
