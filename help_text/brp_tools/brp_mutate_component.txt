Apply mutations to entity components using the bevy/mutate_component BRP method. Modifies specific fields within a component without replacing the entire component.

This is useful for:
- Making targeted updates to component properties
- Animating specific component values
- Building component editors
- Fine-grained entity manipulation

Parameters:
- entity (required): The entity ID containing the component to mutate
- component (required): The fully-qualified type name of the component to mutate
- path (required): The path to the field within the component (e.g., 'translation.x')
- value (required): The new value for the field
- port (optional): The BRP port (default: 15702)

Path syntax:
- Use dots to access nested fields: "transform.translation.x"
- Use brackets for array/vec indices: "points[2]"
- Complex paths are supported: "mesh.vertices[0].position.y"

Example usage:
```json
{
  "entity": 123,
  "component": "bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform",
  "path": "translation.y",
  "value": 10.5
}
```

Benefits over insert:
- Only modifies the specified field
- Preserves other fields in the component
- More efficient for frequent updates
- Ideal for animation and real-time manipulation

Error cases:
- Entity not found
- Component not present on entity
- Invalid path for component structure
- Type mismatch for value

IMPORTANT: Components must be properly registered with BRP and support reflection.
